# ROVC_2022
 *******  All the programs I code and used for controlling a remotely operated vehicle    *****
 
 These is folder structure of programs i used to coontrol the thrusters which are a so called engine to move my underwater vehicle
 at initial stages i was given only three thrsuters in command terminal control the code is for three thrusters and in later stages in Gui section the code is for four thrusters
 
 first install the dependencies in requirements.txt (Manually)  
 the program is for running on pi so all commands may not work on windows use linux preferabbly
 
 if you wanna run only thrusters and not the camers part , comment the code accodingly and skip installing all the dependencies you can know by seeing which you want and which you don't
 
iF i add anything or modify anything i'll commit it for sure in future
